# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository contains the final project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, clean, and create a tidy data set that can be used for later analysis.

## Files Included

- `run_analysis.R`: R script that performs the data cleaning and creates a tidy data set.
- `tidy_data.txt`: The final tidy data set output.
- `CodeBook.md`: Describes the variables, data, and transformations performed.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project and how to use the scripts.

## How to Run the Script

1. Download and unzip the data from:
   [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

2. Place the `UCI HAR Dataset` folder in your working directory.

3. Open R or RStudio and set your working directory to the location where `run_analysis.R` is saved:

```r
setwd("~/Desktop/CourseraProject")  # Example path (update it to match yours)
